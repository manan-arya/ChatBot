Review
"I would like to mention this course as Life changing one. I took this course, just to have an idea about python, but with Jose Portilla's teaching style, I was able to engage myself in this course a lot. I was able to grasp all the concepts and I had a good practise with repeated exercises and challenge problems. After completing this course, I even enrolled two other courses from Jose Portilla. I dream to become a data scientist in future following Josh's footsteps."
"Must take course for anyone who has no prior programming language experience / is a beginner in python. Very informative and comprehensive course. Easy to understand.

"
"An excellent course starting from basics to all advanced levels of mastering Python. As usual Jose Portialla keeps you engaged and motivated to go on and master the subject, really awesome! Thanks to Jose and the entire team at Udemy for this wonderful experience."
"Great pace, I watched through the lectures in a week and I feel comfortable writing in this Python. Now if I need to find a particular function or syntax I can go back to the videos and cut down on my search time significantly

"Helpful Instructor, no question of his knowledge whatsoever. Probably that's were my problem is coming from. I generally miss more detailed explanation here and there (by that I mean explanation for _Dummies_, I am a complete beginner) as I feel that we rush through more complicated or logical structures like Loops …

Loops are just my latest struggle but that stands for earlier lessons …

We are advised to go on Google, ask around, find examples, etc. My problem with those sources is that most of them cover the topics _in a slightly different context_ than what we learn here so I instantly get screwed by those.

As again, someone who already has a basic programming knowledge this can be okay, but for an absolute beginner it's a real pain which I am not sure I should suffer."
"I had no previous exposure to any programming language. I could still get a good understanding of the language and am able to code just by following the videos and solving exercises. The barrier i had for learning python is broken and I can take my skill higher with more practice.

This is a well thought out course and easy to understand."
"Excellent Course! Easy to understand, clear explanations, informative, very well organized. I always wanted such type of training. The Instructor is very prompt in replying to doubts. The course is very well designed, practical and valuable for anyone who wants to enhance their skills. Thank you."
"I enjoyed the course. The concepts were explained in a simple and concise manner. The study material provided also helps if you want to study offline. Definitely shows the amount of hard work put in by the instructor. The chat section is also responsive and interactive. All my doubts were answered by awesome people in this community. Topics like OOP and generators, which can be really frustrating to go through as a beginner, were taught in the best way possible for a beginner.If you don't know anything about programming in Python, this course is a good start for diving into Python.

Some questions on advanced python modules would be helpful. There is no quiz for that section."
"Very good course, highly recommended. There could be a bit more exercises and the difficulty of the big projects could be decreased some as well, but this difficulty is to be expected from a course meant for all levels of learners. Take this course seriously and after a month or two you could be at an intermediate level in Python, use it consistently after that and you will be an expert in no time!

"
"Overall course was a biggest hurdle to me that I have achieved now, I have learnt so much from here so, I could begin my journey. That's all I need and I get what I was expected. Thanks to Jose and Udemy team.

"
"thank you for the course like it :), now I have the foundation to go all through python development more advanced.

This course recommended for you that like to learn by doing.

why don't I give five-star? because this course doesn't bring me to be a actual hero on python, but this is a good start though:)"
"I'm new to programming , and I don't feel any difficulty in understanding this course. GREAT EXPLANATION! Basics have been very clear so far. Course is becoming much more interesting as I move ahead. Thanks Jose.!

"
"I have gone through roughly 55% of the course and everything is well explained, especially after the update to Python 3. Certain things were omitted in Python 2 but in this version Professor covered everything so I have complete understanding of the course so far. Great job

"This course is amazing for beginners , you will find almost everything you need to start coding with Python , the most impressive thing in this course is the two mile stone projects ( Tic Tac Toe and Blackjack! ) you can apply almost everything you learned in the course by creating those projects , and they will give you self confidence if you are not familiar with coding"
"I really enjoyed this course. The Jupiter notebooks were like a separate text. I read the notebooks and tried to learn as much as I could from them, the watched the lectures for more depth and practice. The pace was reasonable, and the explanations were very clear. I have already signed up for two more courses from this instructor!

"
It is in high level. As for the beginners it is very difficult to understand.
"It was a good way to start with Python , clear with possibility to contact the instructor if there is any problem.

Thanks for the instructor , you are really professional , helpful, clear and have a very good way to explain"
"I don't know about python language. This course boost my confidence from 0 to 100. Thanks.
"
"I got off to a good start with this course, even though some of the exercises seemed awfully difficult. I made it as far as the first milestone project and got stuck, so I went back to the start to try and brush up on the basics... then again. I've since struggled to make much progress. I'm now wondering if I might have progressed faster with a different course.

I've enjoyed learning python so far, even though I'm feeling a bit frustrated, but I'm going to stick with it. I find some of the worked examples are a bit weak, and while the instructor is obviously trying to keep things simple, it just doesn't demonstrate how you'd use something (like args of kwargs) in the real world.
"
"Going good so far, let us actually begin with course and more detailed technical items. Also I request you to add more on job kind of exercises which actually helps a lot."
"Add more examples and questionnaires.

Thanks,

Regards,

Trilok"
"The course is quite extensive. It really gives an overview of how Python works. By no doubts I can recommend it to everyone who plans to develop Python knowledge and skills, even to ones who are already familiar with basic Python concepts.
"
"I think it was an awesome course, I really appreciate that. Sure I would like more examples of real world application, but its totally comprehensive that best examples for me is not the same as to the others so... Jose you have already got a student for your Django course. ""Welcome to the Django"""
I loved the voice and teaching attitude or pedagogy of Jose Portilla. Content is exceptionally well for a beginner. Return on Investment is humongous.

"Its really cool, fast-paced training. I have invested 2-3 hours since i have purchases this course and i am almost at the end with good skills on python."
The Exercises given in this course is really good and Overall the course experience is good for beginners. I would be glad if the concepts were explained with real-world examples.
"
I am a begineer in python with little programming knowledge of C++."
"
For those who want to learn python from scratch whether having programming background in other language or not,It is a course you are searching for.........Good Luck!!!!!"
"
The way the material is structured really helps understanding the concepts (and the instructor also has a lot to do with this by being crystal clear in the videos). Normally if I was missing something or was't not sure about it, I'd get an answer and explanation in a few minutes of video without having to google it. This is very helpful, when someone is trying to master a completely new conception."
Very well designed course. The lectures were simple and were easy to understand and the notebooks were very helpful. Overall a very good learning course.
"It is good course to start with Python. You will definitely get more than intermediate knowledge, once you complete this course."
"Very well structured course, with logical explanations of the material covered. Clear lectures and useful, well balanced assessments throughout the entirety of the course."
"I just loved the way this course is designed, i was learning python first time but after completing functions, i feel very confident in solving problems."
"Only thing i would say to a new person who is looking at this. This is how you get started in python programming. Programming is a lot of practice out side the class room. So if you think your gonna take this class then think become a super star well i am sorry its gonna be a lot of work in this class and out side of it. basically you have to use what you learn from the notebook and videos to practice in your free time. If you do you will do you well if not o well ! sucks to be you. Your not entitled to become the best with one class. Keep learning and finding new this to make with python or

learn more about problems to solving python on your own time"
"Very clear diction, and explanations, without seeming slow or patronising.

The homeworks and tests really set the course apart from stuff I've studied on pluralsight. Without the interaction, it's just another watch-and-forget.

"I'm an experienced C# and Java programmer, but after being handed a Python project, I realized I couldn't easily leverage my experience to complete the task. I've had success with Udemy courses before so I turned to them again in my search. After listening to all of the other course introductions, I settled on Jose's course because the pace seemed right, and most importantly for me, the voice was clear and presentable. I wasn't disappointed. A lot of how I judge a course is based on how often I need to query external sources, like StackOverflow, to get a better understanding of a topic. During this entire course, I only did that once. To me, that's a really good sign. I was lucky enough to be able to run this course during business hours, and, using most of each day, it took about a month to complete. I'm now back on my original task, and it is fairly easy. I will succeed, and I credit this course for that.
"
"Before the course, I had only very basic Python skills, and now I can already write some pretty cool stuff with Python 3. I very much liked Jose's teaching style, as well as the exercises and tests. However, I would have preferred more focus on working with IDEs. Some of the examples don't work quite so well in e.g. Spyder, most notably the GUI section, so I ended up skipping much of it.
"
"It was an amazing experience learning fundamental of Python Programming from scratch to applying them in a real world. The simplicity in teaching concepts was great indeed, I feel confident in applying them to any situation right from pre-defined functions to loops that could solve the issues efficiently. I have already recommended your courses to my friends and they're loving it too. Keep the great work going, Jose! I wish my unemployment could bear more of your courses. Cheers!

"This course was fantastic for learning Python syntax and beginning to think about problems in a Pythonic way. A lot of material is covered to give you a comprehensive overview of everything.

That being said, I do wish the exercises were more filled out. Having come from a computer science background and already having exposure with other languages like Java before doing this course, I can attest to the fact that when learning programming, practice is key. The instructor does include practice for each module, but it's not that much and it's quite easy. Then the milestone projects come along and they are substantially harder (and would likely not be possible for someone to do from scratch unless they had prior CS/programming experience).

In conclusion, if you have some experience and are interested in adding Python to your arsenal, this course is 100% worth the money. However, if you're a complete beginner, consider another resource such as Harvard's CS50 on edX and then come back to this later to get the most bang for your buck.

"i'm 58% done and i love this course! i struggled for many months to learn a language and i found udemy and this course and signed up to learn and so i did! Hands down you can learn python too just don't give up its all about the practice and trying it over and over again till it clicks and it will i promise
What I wanted was to learn Python as a pre-requisite for some machine learning/deep learning courses that are taught using it.
"
"Started with C, Matlab, and some older languages, so needed to learn ""the Python way"" to manage typical basic operations, functions, oop, etc. This made things seem a bit slow-paced for me.

Appreciated the thoroughness and well organized approach. A little light humor helped. Pace was probably a reasonable balance between needs of a newcomer and needs of person learning ""just another language"".

Excercises were extremely helpful.
